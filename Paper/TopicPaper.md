###Partners:

###Paper Topic: 
For my paper I will be descussing the implimentation of lamda functinos in C++11 and their usefullness.  
A simple example of a lamda functions is:  
<code>  
int main() {   
  auto func = [] () { cout << "Hello, World!"; };  
    func(); // now call the function  
}  
</code>

This code is the HelloWorld.cpp program that we are all familiar with only it uses a lamda function  
to print "Hello, World!".  In my paper i will talk about why lamda expressions where needed for C++11  
and how they make programming easier and or more efficent. In summary i will talk about:   
  
1) Lamda Funtion syntax  
* How to write Lamda functions including the syntax, return types, paramaters, ect.   
  
2) How to use Lamda Funtctions  
* Knowing how to impement something is only half the battle, you must also know how to implement the  
function and use it.  
* Know when it can be used and when it cannot.    
  
3) Where they are useful  
* Lamda functions are only useful in particular areas, it is important to distinguish between when  
it is appropriate to use a lamda function and when it is not.   

4) Varialbe capture using Lamda Functions and how they are use and for what.  
* This is a unique propertie of lamda funtions and understanding them will better help you use   
lamda funtions effectivly.  

5) Lamda closers and how they are implimented.   
* Talk about he dangers of and benifits of capturing variables by refereance as well as how   
to capture other things as well.  
  
  
  
### Resorces
------------
So far i am still gathering information on how to implement lamda functions correctly and  
effectively. I have come across an article from 
[www.cprogramming.com](http://www.cprogramming.com/c++11/c++11-lambda-closures.html) 
that has been walking  
me through the "just" of it.
